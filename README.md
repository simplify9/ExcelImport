## Intro

*ExcelImport* is a library that provides importing methods to overload.
The main function is checking out `ExcelService` with its import method. It takes in a URL and some other options. 
*ExcelImport* has a loader. We use it check in services. The way to do that is it takes in a URL, passes it to the reader (another service), and reads it. These are all services provided by *ExcelImport*, which means the user can use the services either individually or use the big `ExcelService` to import them, which includes all underlying services.

The `reader`: takes in a file URL, some methods, and overloads of the same methods.

URL in question is the URL of a local file.

All that the `ExcelService` does is import the local file and how to parse this into a json and then it just reaches the individual rows. It also has an excel repo, which is an abstraction in the dbContext, a way into the database.

## Technical stuff

The options: the user needs to specify the naming stategy (camelCase, CapitalCase, snake_case).
